<h2>un-rigid practices on abstract moving images and music</h2>
<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>
This note is on purpose that describe the concept and the method of my audio and visual performance, as graduation work in Inter Media Art Cource of Graduate School of Fine Arts, Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music. I describe the concept and the method of my work with the audio / visual practices in later '90s, which depend on the ideas of anti-direction / anti-composition / anti-expression as the background of my work on this note.<br>
The first section is about the music, picks up "Lap Top Orchestra" as a form of "improvisation" which uses personal computers. I deal with the musical matters of chance in an aspect of "listening" through the section. Following, I notice that "editing" technology (of sound) could invalidate the differences between an intention to plot a whole of a piece (composition) and an interpretation of a piece (playing). Especially, I refer "Onkyo-ha (acoustic sculpture / new experimental music)" which is one of the generic name of experimental musics in later '90s  as an example of practice that makes such invalidation to its positive attitude.<br>
The second section is about the abstract moving images which are nearly the field of "Onkyo-ha" in attitude. I attempt to find a same idea of anti-composition / anti-expression in anti-directional attitudes of moving image practices. Following, I consider the attitudes that avoid representation (like "imaged" drawing) through surplus (or scanty) information. The abandonment of plotting a whole of a work means that making a point of physical effects of sound or light, here.<br>
I state the concept of my graduation work (performance of audio and visual) that planed on the former context and background in the third section. This work aims to be disturbed outline of "piece" or piece making "author" by using "motion" (for avoiding one conclusion or direction). And I notice the idea and the method of improvising performance unit "pico pico stomachs" and audio-visual performance unit "FONOTIAC" in the last of this note, which make the technical basis and the theme of my work.
